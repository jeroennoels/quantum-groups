\noindent
In \cite{Jeroen:QE2:haar}\ we proposed an algebraic setting in which to
perform harmonic analysis on non-compact, non-discrete quantum groups and
in particular on quantum $E(2)$.
In the present paper we shall explicitly construct Fourier transforms between quantum $E(2)$
and its Pontryagin dual, involving Hahn-Exton \mbox{$q$-Bessel} functions as
kernel, prove Plancherel \&\ inversion formulas etc.
We also develop a theory of $q$-Hankel transformation of entire functions,
based on the definition proposed in \cite{KoornwSwartt}\@.

\paragraph{Introduction}
Since this paper depends so heavily on all the preparations made
in \cite{Jeroen:QE2:haar}, it would be quite impossible to make
the present paper self-contained, and thus we shall not make an
attempt to do so. However, together these two papers are more or
less self-contained, and in fact they are really to be thought of
as parts I and II of a single text. Throughout this text, $q$
denotes a real number with \mbox{$0<q<1$}.
